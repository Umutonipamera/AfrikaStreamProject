  A user will receive 'text' asks open registration page.  
  Once a user reaches to registration page will need to put in his/her  phone number  to register and number should be valid ( 10 digits + 2 for country  code).
 
 If the phone number is empty, use popup (“Phone number is empty”).
 If the phone number is too long, use popup("Please put a valid phone number").
 If the phone is to correct length, send a pop  on the page with a random code. 
 
 A user will be asked to put in this code for the server to verify if the code matches with phonenumber.
 Once code will not match with phonenumber, the user will be asked to try again.
 Once code matches with phonenumber the success message will popup on the page and the user will be able to proceed to  next page.
 Once a user get to home page, will be able to apload a video as a file.
 This video will go to the server and the server will return a link to the user that can be used to watch the video.
